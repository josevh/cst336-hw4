# HW 4: Express

Redo HW1 using Express. 

It must use "partials". 
It must also use the "faker" package in the backend to include random fake data.

**Hint:**  To pass data from a route to a view use this syntax in the route:

```javascript
res.render("fileToRender.ejs", {"variableName":value});
```

And then, in the `fileToRender.ejs` use this syntax to display the value passed:

```javascript
<%= variableName %>
```

**Note that the file to render must have `ejs` extension, not `html`.**
